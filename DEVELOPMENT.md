# NebulaGraph Desktop Development Progress

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: NebulaGraph Desktop
- **Description**: Cross-platform desktop application to run NebulaGraph using Docker, featuring a modern Electron app with Next.js (TypeScript) frontend and Shadcn UI components.
- **Target Audience**: Developers and users wanting to run NebulaGraph without Linux expertise or complex setup.
- **Primary Goal**: Deliver an accessible, visually appealing desktop app for running NebulaGraph on Windows and macOS.

## Current State (Milestone 1)

### âœ… Completed Features

#### Portal
- Modern, responsive landing page with hero section
- Smooth transition to dashboard
- Professional branding and messaging

- Cross-service dependency management

### ðŸ”„ In Progress

#### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Enhanced logging interface
  - Better log formatting
  - Log level filtering
  - Timestamp localization
  - Search/filter capabilities
- [ ] Service card interactions refinement
- [ ] Loading states and transitions
- [ ] Error message presentation

#### Technical Debt
- [ ] Docker compose path handling best practices
- [ ] Windows compatibility for Docker commands
- [ ] Build script for Docker image management
- [ ] Service startup sequence optimization

## Technical Implementation

### Docker Configuration

#### Images Used
- vesoft/nebula-graphd:v3.8.0
- vesoft/nebula-metad:v3.8.0
- vesoft/nebula-storaged:v3.8.0
- vesoft/studio:v3.8.0

#### Data Persistence Strategy
- Map volumes to user-specific directories:
  - macOS: ~/nebula-data
  - Windows: %USERPROFILE%\nebula-data
- Use Node.js os and path modules for dynamic paths

### Architecture

#### Current Implementation
- Electron + Next.js for cross-platform support
- Docker for service management
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn for styling
- React for UI components

#### Key Components
- Main Process (Electron)
  - Docker service management
  - IPC communication
  - System tray integration
- Renderer Process (Next.js)
  - Modern UI with Shadcn components
  - Real-time status updates
  - Service controls

## Next Steps (Milestone 2)

### ðŸ“¦ Packaging & Distribution
- [ ] Create build pipeline for all platforms
- [ ] Embed required Docker images
  - Save images as tar files
  - Implement loading mechanism
- [ ] Implement image loading/verification on first start
- [ ] Add auto-update mechanism
- [ ] Create installers for all platforms
  - Windows (NSIS installer)
  - macOS (DMG package)
  - Linux (AppImage)

### ðŸ›  Infrastructure
- [ ] Improve error handling and recovery
- [ ] Add telemetry (opt-in)
- [ ] Implement crash reporting
- [ ] Add system requirements checker
- [ ] Improve Docker Desktop detection and integration

### ðŸ’» Developer Experience
- [ ] Add development documentation
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add test coverage
  - Unit tests for core functionality
  - Integration tests for Docker operations
  - E2E tests for UI flows

### ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Enhancements
- [ ] Add onboarding experience
- [ ] Implement guided first-time setup
- [ ] Add tooltips and help documentation
- [ ] Create advanced configuration UI
- [ ] Improve service logs presentation

## Known Issues

1. Logging UI needs improvement for better readability and interaction
2. Docker commands may need adjustment for Windows compatibility
3. Docker compose path handling could be more robust
4. Service startup sequence could be optimized
5. Need proper handling of Docker image embedding and loading

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding a proper logging framework
- Evaluate alternative Docker management approaches
- Plan for plugin architecture
- Consider adding a database for settings/state persistence
- Explore WSL 2 integration improvements for Windows
